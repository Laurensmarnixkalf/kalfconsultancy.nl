                    <h1>Product discovery</h1>
                    <p>The product invention process is fundamentally a creative process. It is more art than science. That is why the term
                        “product discovery” has been proposed.  First you need to discover whether there are real users who actually
                        experience the identified problem. Then you need to discover a solution to this problem that is valuable, usable
                        and feasible.
                        Oftentimes it can be very hard to discover the solution to the identified market opportunity. The management team
                        of a company can find this very hard to take, they would much rather see the phase of product discovery as a much
                        more predictable part of the whole process. It’s tempting for them to push the product team into development. If
                        this happens too soon, we run into a really common mistake. This is a very costly mistake. Effectively, the
                        expensive engineering team will be used to validate the solution, instead of using the inexpensive high fidelity
                        prototype to iterate towards the right solution to the problem.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">“Take your time to find the right mix of form and function that results in a winning product.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h6 class="">Fundamental questions</h6>
                    <p>Make a clear distinction between the product discovery phase and the execution phase. During the execution, the
                        specs, designs, ideas need to remain constant. Let the development team build the solution right.  One thing you
                        can do to manage this for yourself, as a product manager, and for stakeholders, is to always keep working in
                        parallel on different versions. When the development team is working on version 1.0, you can move your creative
                        product discovery efforts to version 2.0.
                    </p>
                    <img src=''>
                    <p>The product discovery process is all about answering these questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>What <mark>technologies</mark> can I apply to solve this problem in a better way?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What should the user experience be?</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Winning products come from the deep understanding of the user’s needs combined with an equally deep understanding of
                        what’s just now possible.
                    
                        If you already have a launched product, you can learn a great deal from talking to active customers. Which parts do
                        they like? Which parts don’t they like? The game will be about refining the product rather than building a new one.
                        The rules of product discovery however, still apply. </p>
