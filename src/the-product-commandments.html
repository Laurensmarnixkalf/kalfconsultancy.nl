            <h1>The Product commandments</h1>
            <p>Having a set of rules, principles or commandments can really help to determine the right trade-offs and priorities
                within your product or service.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">“The product commandments are a public declaration of your beliefs and intentions.”</p>
            </blockquote>
               
            <p>There will be many instances when tough decisions have to be made. Having a good set of product commandments can
                really help to speed up the process of product discovery.
                Keep in mind that product commandments is not a list of product requirements, it’s of a higher strategic order. The
                commandments help to make important decisions down the road about product requirements.
                It’s not enough to only list your product commandments, you have to make it a prioritized list. Try to formulate
                your commandments as useful as possible. This means: not too generic.
            
                The commandments will help when tough discussions are preventing the team from moving forward. In those
                discussions, you as a product manager, can help by asking the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What problem exactly are you trying to solve?</li>
                <li>Who exactly are you trying to solve this problem for - which persona?</li>
                <li>What are the goals you are trying to satisfy with this product?</li>
                <li>What is the relative priority of each goal? (How do they relate to the product commandments?)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s really important to take prioritization seriously. Make it as transparent as possible. Get the team to agree on
                a specific ordering before moving on. If you skip this step you won’t have a common basis (the set of commandments)
                to fall back on for evaluation of the different opinions and arguments.</p>
