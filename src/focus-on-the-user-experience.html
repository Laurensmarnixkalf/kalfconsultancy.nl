                    <h1>The user experience</h1>
                    <p>Most companies give far too little attention to usability in every type of product (especially enterprise software!)
                        but, with a (consumer) Internet service, there simply is no getting around that it’s really all about the user
                        experience. If you can’t find a way to make your service something that the target user can figure out how to
                        use—and provide them with an idea of why they should use it—then you’re going nowhere fast. Also remember that
                        performance is a key factor in usability. If a page takes too long to load, people will think it’s broken or just
                        go elsewhere because the experience is bad.</p>

                    <h6 class="">Engineers vs. UX design</h6>
                    <p>It’s important to keep in mind that engineers are usually very poor at user experience design. That’s mostly because
                        they have to think in terms of implementation models, while users think in terms of conceptual models. Make sure
                        that you pay attention to both the <mark>interaction</mark> design and the <mark>visual</mark> design. Creating an awesome design does not
                        magically happen while sitting at a desk, it happens over many iterations and feedback loops with real users. That
                        is why the high fidelity prototype is so important. If you can get through at least 5 consecutive user tests with
                        your high fidelity prototype where each individual was able to complete all of the proposed tasks, you’re generally
                        good to go.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="">Collaboration from the start</h6>
                    <p>In order to get to a good user experience design, there needs to be close collaboration between the user experience
                        designer(s) and the product manager. See this close collaboration as a constant mix of input from the different
                        roles where the goal is to discover the blend of requirements and design that meets the needs of the user. The end
                        result needs to be both usable and valuable.</p>

                    <h6 class="">TL;DR</h6>
                    <p>You'll see the best results when you work towards an optimal user experience from the start.
