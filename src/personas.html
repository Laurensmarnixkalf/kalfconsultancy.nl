                    <h1>Personas</h1>
                    <h6 class="">Who are we designing and building for?</h6>
                    <p>
                        A persona is a representation of a type of customer. Creating these persona’s should be done based on all the
                        information you have about your customers. Saving all the information together might work best in a sheet, ordered
                        by topic. This will allow you to later see similarities between (types of) users or differences. This will help
                        making decisions to group types of users into one persona, or warranting to split them up in to two (or more). It’s
                        important to remember that this is an iterative proces that needs to evolve over time.</p>
                    <img src='assets/persona.png'>
                    <h6 class="">Some of the questions you might ask yourself about your customers</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>What are the <mark>goals</mark> of our customers?</p></li>
                        <li><p>In what <mark>industry</mark> do our customers work?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How much <mark>time</mark> do they spend on the problem we identified?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Which <mark>devices</mark> do they typically use?</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Name your persona’s in a memorable and characteristic way so the members of your product team can easily remember
                        the persona and see them while talking about him or her.
                        Having different persona’s will allow you to say: “This is a feature that John would use, but Jane would not.”
                        (Remember it’s important to design and build for a specific persona, not for all at the same time, that will lead
                        to too many compromises)
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="">Names make it stick</h6>
                    <p>In order to get to a good user experience design, there needs to be close collaboration between the user experience
                        designer(s) and the product manager. See this close collaboration as a constant mix of input from the different
                        roles where the goal is to discover the blend of requirements and design that meets the needs of the user. The end
                        result needs to be both usable and valuable.</p>
                    <h6 class="">Spread the joy</h6>
                    <p>Make sure to make your persona’s as visible as possible within your company. Share it with everyone, these are the
                        people we’re building our product(s) for!
                        Persona’s also help to prevent us to confuse ourselves with the actual customers. Persona’s will help you identify
                        the different types of users and will help you prioritize their individual importance. It’s about prioritization,
                        not about pleasing everyone.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h6 class="">TL;DR</h6>
                    <p>Make the call: which persona is our priority? (This might change over time, but you need to have focus!)
                        Take the time to talk to real users and verify whether your target users really exist.
