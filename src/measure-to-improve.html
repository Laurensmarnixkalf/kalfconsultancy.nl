                    <h1>Measures of improvement</h1>
                    <p>If we, as product managers, are doing our jobs, we strive towards improvement and adding value on a daily basis. But
                        how do we measure whether all our efforts actually lead to results?
                        The digital world is full of metrics that can be of help. There is one however, that stands out: The Net Promotor
                        Score (NPS). It revolves around the following question:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">"How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h6 class="">NPS scores</h6>
                    <p>Those who respond to this question are asked to give a score anywhere between 0 and 10. The people who respond with
                        a score of 9 or 10 are called 'Promotors'. People who respond with a 0 to 6 are labeled 'Detractors'. And the
                        people who responded with a 7 or 8 are 'Passives'.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="">Why NPS</h6>
                    <p>The tool aims to measure the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer. The NPS is seen as an
                        alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth. The NPS
                        has been widely adopted by the bigger part of the Fortune 1000 companies, and for good reasons.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="">Calculate NPS</h6>
                    <p>The NPS is calculated by subtracting the % of 'detractors' from the % of 'promotors'. For purposes of calculating a
                        Net Promoter Score, Passives count toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of
                        detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0. It can be very valuable to add an open question to
                        the NPS question to allow the respondent to elaborate on the reasons why they gave their answer. The feedback that
                        is gathered this way can be interesting for a follow-up interview to identify problems and learn more about your
                        users.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="">There is much more</h6>
                    <p>Next to the NPS there are of course many more metrics and statistics that can be used to measure the success of your
                        efforts as a product manager. Before measuring anything, it all starts with having a clear idea of what you want to
                        achieve. In all cases it's important to find the metrics you need to track whether you improve or not.
                        Focus on pursuing your metrics by observing live use and work your numbers in the right direction.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h6 class="">TL;DR</h6>
                    <p>The NPS is not the <mark>holy grail</mark>, but it's a good measure to figure out whether you are building a product that is well received by your users.</p>
